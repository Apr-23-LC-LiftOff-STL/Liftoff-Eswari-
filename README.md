README: Along the Way Application

The code provided is for the implementation of the "Along the Way" application, which is designed to assist users in planning road trips by providing route information, weather data, and points of interest along the route. 
The application is built using the Angular framework and utilizes various APIs, such as Google Maps, OpenWeatherMap, and Google Places.

Key Features:

Routing: The application allows users to input their start and end locations, along with any desired stops, and calculates the optimal driving route using the Google Maps Directions API. The route is displayed on an interactive map.

Weather Information: Along the calculated route, the application retrieves weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays the current weather conditions and temperature at the start, end, and waypoints of the trip. Users can also view the weather forecast for specific waypoints by selecting a time along the route.

Vehicle Details: Users can input their vehicle's average miles per gallon (MPG) and tank capacity. This information is used to calculate the total gas cost and number of tanks needed for the trip based on the route distance.

Points of Interest: Users can specify an interest, such as restaurants, gas stations, or attractions, and the application searches for relevant points of interest along the route using the Google Places API. The results are displayed on the map and in a list, providing users with options for places to visit during their trip.

Interactive Map: The application includes an interactive map powered by the Google Maps API, which displays the calculated route, points of interest markers, and weather icons. Users can interact with the map, zoom in/out, and view additional information by clicking on markers.

Usage:

Install the necessary dependencies and libraries for the Angular application.
Obtain API keys for Google Maps, OpenWeatherMap, and Google Places, and update the corresponding variables in the environment.ts file.
Run the Angular application using the appropriate commands (ng serve, for example).
Access the application through a web browser and input the start and end locations for your road trip.
Optionally, add any desired stops along the route and specify your vehicle's MPG and tank capacity.
Submit the form to calculate the route, display weather information, and search for points of interest.
Interact with the map and explore the displayed information to plan your road trip accordingly.
Note:

It's important to set up the necessary API credentials and ensure they are properly configured in the environment variables to enable the functionality of the application.
