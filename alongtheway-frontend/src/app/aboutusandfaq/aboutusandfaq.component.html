    Our website project is a road trip planner that allows for convenient 
  planning compared to having to use Google Maps manually. It will allow you 
  to select your hobbies and use them to find points of interest both along 
  your route as well as at your destination. It will also help you calculate 
  fuel costs and strategically choose the best places to get gas to save 
  money.
